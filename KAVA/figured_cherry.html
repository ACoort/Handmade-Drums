                <p>This piece of figured cherry was located by one of our guys at an exotic wood shop in Burlington, Ontario.  The shell has a beautiful character that the pics can't do all that much justice for.  This one was a great sounding drum as soon as the heads were put on and the tuning roughed in.  </p>
